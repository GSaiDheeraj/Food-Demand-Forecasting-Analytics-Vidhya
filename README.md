## What is the target Column?

Since the problem statement is to find the demand of the Food supply , num_orders which gives the information orders count will be the target variable because if a particular food item x was order n number of times and food item y ordered 2x number of times we can tell item y has more demand and we nee to predict that demand                                                                  

In addition to the above point the num_order column was not given in test.csv file.üòù                                                      
Question) There are some other columns as well that aren't given in test.csv file what about those?
Answer) Probably we can use them for feature engineering purpose(For creating more features)


## What is the Use Case?

The replenishment of raw materials is done only on weekly basis and since the raw material is perishable, the procurement planning is of utmost importance.  


Predicting the Demand helps in reducing the wastage of raw materials which would result in the reduced cost of operation. Increased customer satisfaction by timely fulfilling their expectations and requirements.
